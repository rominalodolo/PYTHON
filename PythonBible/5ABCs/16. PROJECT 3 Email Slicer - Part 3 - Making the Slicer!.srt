1

00:00:00,460  -->  00:00:01,900
Ello there you beautiful people.

2

00:00:01,920  -->  00:00:04,820
And in this lecture we're going to create the e-mail slicer.

3

00:00:04,830  -->  00:00:06,260
So I hope you're excited.

4

00:00:06,300  -->  00:00:07,600
This project going to tied together.

5

00:00:07,620  -->  00:00:09,730
Everything we've learned about strings in this section.

6

00:00:09,830  -->  00:00:14,720
So it is gathering user input slicing string formatting and even the occasional string method.

7

00:00:14,910  -->  00:00:19,230
So basically how this is going to work is that we're going to ask the user for their e-mail address

8

00:00:19,260  -->  00:00:20,840
using the input function.

9

00:00:21,000  -->  00:00:25,440
After that we're going to slice the e-mail address for the user name and the email domain name and the

10

00:00:25,440  -->  00:00:29,570
user name is what is before the at symbol and the domain name is what's after the at symbol.

11

00:00:29,580  -->  00:00:34,470
In case you're wondering so we're going to use string formatting to output the user a message that tells

12

00:00:34,470  -->  00:00:36,380
in their user name and their domain name.

13

00:00:36,420  -->  00:00:37,550
Pretty cool right.

14

00:00:37,560  -->  00:00:42,240
So after this ledger you have to understand how each of the different pieces regarding strings fits

15

00:00:42,240  -->  00:00:45,980
together and you also can have built another core python program to prove it.

16

00:00:45,990  -->  00:00:47,640
Let's get started.

17

00:00:47,640  -->  00:00:54,750
So the first thing I'm going to do is create another script so go far new file save this on the desktop

18

00:00:55,020  -->  00:00:59,420
in the python Bible and I'm going to call this slice a dot P Y.

19

00:00:59,420  -->  00:01:01,980
And when I maximize this were all good to go.

20

00:01:02,190  -->  00:01:06,330
So I'm going to use Python comments to help give us a bit of an outline for what we're going to do in

21

00:01:06,330  -->  00:01:07,340
the project.

22

00:01:07,350  -->  00:01:10,280
The first thing we're going to do is to get the user's email address.

23

00:01:10,350  -->  00:01:18,220
So get user e-mail address then we're going to slice out the user name slice out user name we'll go

24

00:01:18,260  -->  00:01:25,500
to slice out the domain name slice demesne name we'll go to format some kind of output message so format

25

00:01:25,500  -->  00:01:29,870
message and then was going to display the output message.

26

00:01:29,970  -->  00:01:33,450
So display output message.

27

00:01:33,690  -->  00:01:34,100
Awesome.

28

00:01:34,110  -->  00:01:35,730
That's easy enough right.

29

00:01:35,730  -->  00:01:40,830
All right so now that we've planned though our project Let's go follow the checklist and get the user's

30

00:01:40,830  -->  00:01:42,480
email address nef for this.

31

00:01:42,480  -->  00:01:48,270
As you'll recall to get a to get a input from a user willing to use the input function.

32

00:01:48,420  -->  00:01:54,240
So we're going to call whatever the input is a variable called e-mail and use the input function by

33

00:01:54,240  -->  00:01:55,410
asking them a question.

34

00:01:55,560  -->  00:02:02,200
What is your e-mail address just like that.

35

00:02:02,220  -->  00:02:05,130
I'm also going just going to capitalize it to make sure a little bit nicer.

36

00:02:05,190  -->  00:02:11,370
Now the user may very well type in their e-mail address and then accidentally press a space or something

37

00:02:11,370  -->  00:02:14,660
like that which we don't want inside of our input.

38

00:02:14,970  -->  00:02:20,860
So whatever the user inputs were going to strip away all of the blank spaces from it using the strip

39

00:02:20,860  -->  00:02:22,260
string method.

40

00:02:22,260  -->  00:02:24,060
So while up there we are.

41

00:02:24,060  -->  00:02:25,920
There's the first step of the project done.

42

00:02:26,400  -->  00:02:29,850
So a step number two we need to slice out the user name.

43

00:02:29,850  -->  00:02:32,580
Now the user name is everything up to the at symbol.

44

00:02:32,610  -->  00:02:42,540
So if there you know for example if there you if their e-mail was like Now Barb Doe at finger dot com

45

00:02:42,990  -->  00:02:47,920
then their username would be Bob Dole and the domain there would be Thank you doctor.

46

00:02:48,030  -->  00:02:50,160
Okay so which one the usenet with them in it which is everything.

47

00:02:50,160  -->  00:02:52,360
Up until the at symbol.

48

00:02:52,410  -->  00:03:00,150
So I want you to create a variable called user and using the index function and a slice.

49

00:03:00,150  -->  00:03:08,310
I want you to take a slice of the e-mail variable and which is which corresponds to the to their email

50

00:03:08,310  -->  00:03:08,850
address.

51

00:03:08,850  -->  00:03:10,370
It could be any e-mail address.

52

00:03:10,470  -->  00:03:17,790
So I want you to take use the index function to take a slice up until the at symbol and save that in

53

00:03:17,790  -->  00:03:20,130
the variable called user.

54

00:03:20,190  -->  00:03:26,960
So you know the drop pause the video now and come back when you're done with up to see how you did.

55

00:03:28,830  -->  00:03:30,230
So how do you get on.

56

00:03:30,300  -->  00:03:32,120
This is the way that I'd have gone about doing it.

57

00:03:32,220  -->  00:03:32,680
I would.

58

00:03:32,700  -->  00:03:34,180
Well let me just do this.

59

00:03:34,350  -->  00:03:42,690
I would have created a variable called user and assigned it the value of a slice from e-mail starting

60

00:03:42,690  -->  00:03:49,360
at the beginning opened till the index of the at symbol.

61

00:03:49,570  -->  00:03:50,180
Okay.

62

00:03:50,250  -->  00:03:55,030
So everything up to the at symbol is going to be saved in the user variable.

63

00:03:55,080  -->  00:03:57,270
Nice and easy.

64

00:03:57,270  -->  00:04:02,640
All right so now we need to get the domain name which is everything after the at symbol.

65

00:04:02,730  -->  00:04:08,320
So there's another micro challenge I want you to use slices again to store in a variable called Domain

66

00:04:08,790  -->  00:04:12,600
everything after the at symbol in that email variable.

67

00:04:12,990  -->  00:04:19,980
So go ahead now and pause the video and give that a go try to get everything after the at symbol not

68

00:04:19,980  -->  00:04:21,270
including the outer symbol.

69

00:04:21,270  -->  00:04:27,090
Bear in mind everything after the at symbol all the way until the end of the string and then come back

70

00:04:27,090  -->  00:04:31,380
to see how you did.

71

00:04:31,380  -->  00:04:32,930
How did you know did you get on all right.

72

00:04:33,180  -->  00:04:34,280
There's a bit tricky right.

73

00:04:34,410  -->  00:04:41,790
So the way that I have done it is I'd have create the variable called domain and other set that equal

74

00:04:41,790  -->  00:04:44,050
to a slice from email.

75

00:04:44,520  -->  00:04:51,100
But we want to go from we want to take everything after the V out symbol right.

76

00:04:51,300  -->  00:05:00,390
So the way that I do that is I take the index of the at symbol like that but we don't want to start

77

00:05:00,420  -->  00:05:06,370
there because if we start there then what's going to happen is it's going to include the at symbol.

78

00:05:06,420  -->  00:05:09,730
So I want to take from that index plus one.

79

00:05:09,750  -->  00:05:15,210
I want to go to the one after it then just use a colon to go all the way up until the end of the string

80

00:05:15,210  -->  00:05:15,390
.

81

00:05:15,390  -->  00:05:16,720
So this is the way that I have done it.

82

00:05:16,890  -->  00:05:21,770
Astarte is the index of the of the at symbol plus one.

83

00:05:21,870  -->  00:05:23,880
So it's one after it.

84

00:05:23,940  -->  00:05:27,890
So if the index was five then this would give a six.

85

00:05:27,930  -->  00:05:28,650
She one after.

86

00:05:28,650  -->  00:05:33,210
And then we'd use the coal on to give us a short cut to go all the way until the end of the stream.

87

00:05:33,270  -->  00:05:35,790
And that's going to get us there domain name.

88

00:05:35,870  -->  00:05:36,380
All right.

89

00:05:36,390  -->  00:05:43,290
The next step is to create a the output message and the output message is going to look something like

90

00:05:43,290  -->  00:05:43,640
this.

91

00:05:43,650  -->  00:05:54,320
I'm going to have outputs equals your user name is blank and your domain name is blank.

92

00:05:54,330  -->  00:06:02,730
Now I want you to at the end of this string here to use the Format function to put in the first place

93

00:06:02,940  -->  00:06:08,360
the username and in the second place the domain name which we've taken out from here so is a micro try

94

00:06:08,400  -->  00:06:08,460
.

95

00:06:08,490  -->  00:06:13,980
Use the Format function to put the user name in here the domain name in here then come back to see how

96

00:06:13,980  -->  00:06:16,190
you did.

97

00:06:17,880  -->  00:06:19,430
So hopefully that went well for you.

98

00:06:19,470  -->  00:06:24,090
This is the way that I'd have done it I'd have just typed dot format because format is again a string

99

00:06:24,120  -->  00:06:30,480
method and I'm going to put in the first thing user because that's what holds I use an and then I'm

100

00:06:30,480  -->  00:06:31,510
going to put a comma.

101

00:06:31,530  -->  00:06:37,570
And after that I'm going to put domain because domain holds our domain name and that should be that

102

00:06:37,570  -->  00:06:38,050
so.

103

00:06:38,070  -->  00:06:41,440
Now all we've got to do is print out the output message right.

104

00:06:41,460  -->  00:06:44,290
So print output.

105

00:06:44,610  -->  00:06:47,740
Now when I save and run the lesher see how this works.

106

00:06:47,890  -->  00:06:48,880
Let's.

107

00:06:49,180  -->  00:06:50,830
Okay so what's your e-mail address.

108

00:06:50,850  -->  00:06:59,290
Let's say we have super awesome name at galactic mail dot com right.

109

00:06:59,370  -->  00:07:03,210
This doesn't exist by the way and if it does and you're watching this then you're the unluckiest person

110

00:07:03,210  -->  00:07:04,020
alive.

111

00:07:04,020  -->  00:07:09,510
But anyway if I do that it's going to say your username is super awesome name and your domain name is

112

00:07:09,510  -->  00:07:10,930
galactic mail dot.com.

113

00:07:11,050  -->  00:07:11,790
Hey.

114

00:07:11,940  -->  00:07:19,350
So there we are we managed to slice up an email address into it a user name and its domain name using

115

00:07:19,350  -->  00:07:20,640
Python slices.

116

00:07:20,640  -->  00:07:21,490
Well done.

117

00:07:21,510  -->  00:07:26,110
I bet you mean you should probably give yourself a proper pat on the back if you follow through this

118

00:07:26,120  -->  00:07:31,260
and understand everything and feel now that you have Python strings down pat.

119

00:07:31,260  -->  00:07:33,790
You have Python strings under your belt and you're a master of them.

120

00:07:33,820  -->  00:07:39,330
So Welldone know we've covered a lot in this section of the course and as usual I'm just going to have

121

00:07:39,330  -->  00:07:43,830
a quick recap in the next video of what we've learned to prime you for the next exciting section of

122

00:07:43,830  -->  00:07:45,560
the course on logic.

123

00:07:45,750  -->  00:07:50,790
So congratulations once again on following through this project and being able to create an e-mail slicer

124

00:07:50,810  -->  00:07:51,030
.

125

00:07:51,150  -->  00:07:55,890
I'll see the next video for a recap and then will move on to learn all about logic so I'll see you in

126

00:07:55,890  -->  00:07:56,770
the next video.
