00:00:00,570  -->  00:00:02,050
Hello there you beautiful people.

2

00:00:02,070  -->  00:00:08,010
So this is just another quick video about some of the some useful tricks you can do when you're dealing

3

00:00:08,010  -->  00:00:09,140
with slices.

4

00:00:09,150  -->  00:00:15,360
The first thing I want to show you is you don't have to count from the very beginning in order to get

5

00:00:15,360  -->  00:00:16,650
up to where you want to go.

6

00:00:16,980  -->  00:00:20,380
So you can actually count from this end.

7

00:00:20,520  -->  00:00:22,510
So let's say I wanted you.

8

00:00:22,770  -->  00:00:23,260
Okay.

9

00:00:23,310  -->  00:00:28,160
I could count up 0 1 2 3 4 5 all the way up until you right.

10

00:00:28,230  -->  00:00:32,400
Or I could do word and count back from the other end.

11

00:00:32,430  -->  00:00:37,330
So this value here is actually index minus one.

12

00:00:37,620  -->  00:00:40,750
So you would be index minus two.

13

00:00:40,950  -->  00:00:41,440
Okay.

14

00:00:41,550  -->  00:00:47,010
And they see we get you less safe we wanted this see they'll be minus one minus two minus three minus

15

00:00:47,010  -->  00:00:52,230
four minus five word minus five should give us C..

16

00:00:52,280  -->  00:00:53,190
And it does.

17

00:00:53,220  -->  00:00:54,420
So this is a nice short cut.

18

00:00:54,420  -->  00:01:00,570
You don't have to count all the way from from this and you can can from this and remembering that the

19

00:01:00,570  -->  00:01:02,450
very end value is minus one.

20

00:01:02,460  -->  00:01:07,130
So if you want the very end value you just type minus one and it's going to give us s at the end.

21

00:01:07,470  -->  00:01:15,300
But this doesn't solve the actual issue which is that we're still counting right in our head as a human

22

00:01:15,300  -->  00:01:17,130
being which can make mistakes.

23

00:01:17,220  -->  00:01:23,490
What we want to do is to leverage the power of the computer to do all the counting for us and for that

24

00:01:23,490  -->  00:01:25,860
we're going to use the index function.

25

00:01:26,040  -->  00:01:33,930
So let's say for example I wanted to just take the word calleigh out what I could do is I could type

26

00:01:33,930  -->  00:01:35,510
a word.

27

00:01:35,850  -->  00:01:44,860
And I want where calleigh starts so I could type in here word dot index of callee.

28

00:01:45,160  -->  00:01:45,630
Okay.

29

00:01:45,750  -->  00:01:48,450
Because where starts.

30

00:01:48,460  -->  00:01:51,490
Let me just show you actually I mean just make it a bit simpler.

31

00:01:51,690  -->  00:02:00,870
Index sorry word dot index of calleigh is going to give us five because cow he starts at index five

32

00:02:00,870  -->  00:02:05,070
right 0 1 2 3 4 5 so what.

33

00:02:05,070  -->  00:02:09,630
And we want to go all the way up to fragile.

34

00:02:10,050  -->  00:02:10,530
Right.

35

00:02:10,650  -->  00:02:15,080
So fragile starts at index word dot index.

36

00:02:15,360  -->  00:02:16,920
Fragile is going to give us 9.

37

00:02:17,190  -->  00:02:22,500
So what I could do is to have a word then the first where I want to start at the index of where calleigh

38

00:02:22,500  -->  00:02:30,750
starts and I want to go up to where fragile starts in steps of one by default.

39

00:02:30,930  -->  00:02:35,580
And it's going to give me out callee because it's going to go from where he starts to where the next

40

00:02:35,850  -->  00:02:38,920
to where raji stars and that he's going to pull that out.

41

00:02:39,150  -->  00:02:43,910
So using indexes using the index function is a massive shocker right.

42

00:02:43,920  -->  00:02:47,350
I mean it makes life so much easier to do it that way.

43

00:02:47,490  -->  00:02:51,150
Let's say if we wanted to take out the word doescher.

44

00:02:51,550  -->  00:02:53,550
Okay let's say want to take this out.

45

00:02:53,980  -->  00:03:03,970
All we've got to do is do word of word dot index doescher which is where it starts.

46

00:03:04,350  -->  00:03:04,840
Right.

47

00:03:05,130  -->  00:03:09,170
And I want to go from there to the end just to put a coal on.

48

00:03:09,180  -->  00:03:14,020
It's going to seem odd to go to the end and pull it out which is fantastic.

49

00:03:14,130  -->  00:03:25,770
If I wanted to get out fragile stick around so I just do word of word dark index gradualist stick all

50

00:03:25,770  -->  00:03:28,850
the way up to where I mean to be honest with you.

51

00:03:28,890  -->  00:03:38,160
I could just do XP right word dot index XP fragileness because I could I could just write XP and oceans

52

00:03:38,160  -->  00:03:39,600
are Uecker straight XP.

53

00:03:40,050  -->  00:03:51,390
Now one thing you do have to bear in mind is that index only returns the first instance of that phrase

54

00:03:51,390  -->  00:03:52,790
that you're searching for.

55

00:03:52,800  -->  00:03:56,710
So if I if I wanted to get fragileness to go again.

56

00:03:56,890  -->  00:04:03,310
Okay let's say I went like this and I wanted to go up to word dot index of E.

57

00:04:03,510  -->  00:04:04,910
I don't think that will work.

58

00:04:04,950  -->  00:04:05,760
It won't work right.

59

00:04:05,760  -->  00:04:07,150
It obviously was an empty string.

60

00:04:07,290  -->  00:04:13,710
And the reason is because index the index of E it finds the first E which is over here.

61

00:04:13,800  -->  00:04:15,100
Not this one.

62

00:04:15,690  -->  00:04:23,760
So if you wanted this one you need to say where you know something longer starts XP or XP and oceanus

63

00:04:23,760  -->  00:04:25,710
or something that lets another.

64

00:04:25,710  -->  00:04:31,580
You definitely want this one rather than the first day which is what causes this error here.

65

00:04:31,620  -->  00:04:35,820
So that's something to bear in mind also.

66

00:04:35,970  -->  00:04:39,670
So that's pretty much all there is to slicing to be fair pretty easy right.

67

00:04:39,900  -->  00:04:43,860
So I just have a quick recap of what we've learned in the past two videos just to make sure we've got

68

00:04:43,890  -->  00:04:46,640
everything down before we head into the slicer project.

69

00:04:46,920  -->  00:04:52,950
So we learned that strings are an Iterable immutable datatype and the fact that they are Iterable means

70

00:04:52,950  -->  00:04:56,670
that you can access individual elements from the string.

71

00:04:56,880  -->  00:05:03,750
Each element is given its own index and these start from the number zero and you use that index to access

72

00:05:03,750  -->  00:05:04,890
the element.

73

00:05:04,890  -->  00:05:10,080
You also learn how to take slices from a string and how to take individual elements out yourself and

74

00:05:10,110  -->  00:05:13,440
a short cut for use in the index for by using the index function.

75

00:05:13,470  -->  00:05:16,920
They can take a lot of the hard work of doing this out for us.

76

00:05:17,250  -->  00:05:21,830
Overall you've got a pretty good understanding of what slices are and how to create them by now.

77

00:05:21,840  -->  00:05:26,850
So up next we've got a quick quiz and coding challenge to check that you fully understood what slices

78

00:05:26,850  -->  00:05:27,210
are.

79

00:05:27,300  -->  00:05:29,240
And after that we're going to build our e-mail slicer.

80

00:05:29,400  -->  00:05:33,380
So good luck in the quiz and the coding challenge which you're going to need in order to get some practice

81

00:05:33,380  -->  00:05:33,420
.

82

00:05:33,430  -->  00:05:36,200
Make sure you got it down and then I'll see you in the next video.
