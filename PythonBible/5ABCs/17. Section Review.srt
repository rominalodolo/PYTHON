00:00:00,720  -->  00:00:04,510
Wow we've really covered a lot in this section and a python Bible on strings.

2

00:00:04,710  -->  00:00:08,730
Now in this lecture I just want to make a quick review of what we've covered and also give you a little

3

00:00:08,730  -->  00:00:11,220
taster of what's coming up in the next section.

4

00:00:11,240  -->  00:00:14,640
So after this lecture you'll be feeling really proud of yourself and what you've learned about strings

5

00:00:14,880  -->  00:00:19,110
and hopefully you'll be rather excited for the next section of the Gores on logic which is where all

6

00:00:19,110  -->  00:00:20,720
the really cool stuff happens.

7

00:00:20,760  -->  00:00:21,960
But I won't spoil anything Yeah.

8

00:00:22,110  -->  00:00:23,740
Let's do our review.

9

00:00:23,790  -->  00:00:27,130
We started off by looking at what strings are and how we can make them.

10

00:00:27,150  -->  00:00:31,930
We saw that there are three main ways single quotes double quotes and triple quotes.

11

00:00:31,950  -->  00:00:36,480
Now Python gives us this many ways because it gives us plenty of flexibility when making strings and

12

00:00:36,480  -->  00:00:38,100
also stops our strings from breaking.

13

00:00:38,090  -->  00:00:40,120
When we use certain punctuation.

14

00:00:40,530  -->  00:00:42,640
Next you learned how to be a string mechanic.

15

00:00:42,810  -->  00:00:47,970
By learning how to fix strings if they do get broken and after that you created the legendary hello

16

00:00:47,970  -->  00:00:52,040
world program which entered you into the official realm of Python programmers.

17

00:00:52,110  -->  00:00:53,060
Congratulations.

18

00:00:53,070  -->  00:00:54,860
Welcome to the club.

19

00:00:54,990  -->  00:00:59,340
After that you then sailed through a couple of coding challenges which checked your understanding and

20

00:00:59,340  -->  00:01:03,350
you were then met with a second project of the course the helo you program.

21

00:01:03,360  -->  00:01:07,710
We started off by showing you how to use Python's comments to structure your code and keep your mind

22

00:01:07,740  -->  00:01:10,060
organized and focused on the task at hand.

23

00:01:10,410  -->  00:01:14,820
Next you learned how to take a user's input and store it in variables to be use later in your program

24

00:01:15,180  -->  00:01:20,190
and you then learn how to process these variables and create useful output messages using string concatenation

25

00:01:20,340  -->  00:01:22,160
and string formatting.

26

00:01:22,170  -->  00:01:27,480
You also learned how some data types are incompatible I can't simply be concatenated together like strings

27

00:01:27,480  -->  00:01:28,420
and numbers.

28

00:01:28,590  -->  00:01:30,290
You don't have to resolve problems with data.

29

00:01:30,290  -->  00:01:31,700
Think about Habibti like this.

30

00:01:31,760  -->  00:01:35,940
But learning how to convert or cast from one data type to another.

31

00:01:36,390  -->  00:01:41,130
After that you sailed through another two coding challenges and then you learned all about string methods

32

00:01:41,260  -->  00:01:41,650
.

33

00:01:41,880  -->  00:01:44,870
First you learn what string methods are and how to use them.

34

00:01:44,880  -->  00:01:50,520
Then we went through many useful functions that can do many useful things like finding the index of

35

00:01:50,520  -->  00:01:55,650
a certain string inside another turning our string into upper case or count the amount of time a certain

36

00:01:55,650  -->  00:01:58,100
piece of text appears and so on.

37

00:01:58,140  -->  00:02:02,700
We also learn how to check whether a string was in the correct format with a few string methods as well

38

00:02:02,700  -->  00:02:04,150
.

39

00:02:04,170  -->  00:02:06,240
After that you learned all about slices.

40

00:02:06,300  -->  00:02:11,940
You learn what they are how to use them and also a few shortcuts that makes using slices a dream.

41

00:02:11,940  -->  00:02:15,990
You then had a quick quiz followed by a coding challenge to check your understanding and then we jumped

42

00:02:15,990  -->  00:02:19,950
into a third project of the course that e-mails slicer in that project.

43

00:02:19,950  -->  00:02:24,680
We combine all that we've learned so far to collect user input and store it in a string variable.

44

00:02:24,690  -->  00:02:29,040
You then slice that variable into smaller pieces to get the user name and domain name from the email

45

00:02:29,040  -->  00:02:34,230
address and finally use string formatting to create an output message for the user using the data that

46

00:02:34,230  -->  00:02:36,390
they previously had provided you.

47

00:02:36,480  -->  00:02:41,180
Well done well done well done to see you've done AMAZING.

48

00:02:41,280  -->  00:02:46,200
So as you can see we've covered an incredible amount of stuff in this section and you should be feeling

49

00:02:46,200  -->  00:02:50,530
super confident whenever you have to deal with text in Python now or in the future.

50

00:02:50,550  -->  00:02:51,520
So well done.

51

00:02:51,810  -->  00:02:55,140
The next section of course is one of my favorites at the moment.

52

00:02:55,140  -->  00:03:00,150
Our programs are quite simple and they can only account for one possible route of action.

53

00:03:00,150  -->  00:03:05,490
However life isn't like that and there are usually many possible routes that a user might take to deal

54

00:03:05,490  -->  00:03:07,770
with all of these opportunities and possibilities.

55

00:03:07,770  -->  00:03:12,060
We need a logic in the next section you're going to be learning all about logic in Python.

56

00:03:12,180  -->  00:03:16,270
So the program can respond whichever the way the user chooses to go.

57

00:03:16,350  -->  00:03:20,730
As you can see our Python programs are going to get a whole lot more bad ass so let's jump in and I'll

58

00:03:20,730  -->  00:03:21,900
see you in the next video.
