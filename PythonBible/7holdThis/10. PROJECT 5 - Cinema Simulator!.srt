00:00:00,450  -->  00:00:02,050
Hello there you beautiful people.

2

00:00:02,070  -->  00:00:08,250
No it's time to put added data structure skills to the test by making a cinema simulator.

3

00:00:08,250  -->  00:00:13,440
So this project is going to let users choose from a range of films and the user will pick a film and

4

00:00:13,440  -->  00:00:15,870
then the program will ask them for their age.

5

00:00:16,080  -->  00:00:20,340
If they're old enough to watch the film and there are enough seats available then the program will let

6

00:00:20,340  -->  00:00:22,030
them use a book to see the film.

7

00:00:22,110  -->  00:00:25,980
If not the program will tell them that they're too young or there's nine of seats available or whenever

8

00:00:25,980  -->  00:00:26,330
.

9

00:00:26,340  -->  00:00:28,950
So pretty cool right now by the end of this project.

10

00:00:28,950  -->  00:00:34,500
You should have a great understanding of how variables logic and data structures all tied together to

11

00:00:34,500  -->  00:00:35,350
build programs.

12

00:00:35,400  -->  00:00:37,230
So I can't wait to get started.

13

00:00:37,230  -->  00:00:39,920
Let's jump right in.

14

00:00:39,930  -->  00:00:44,700
So first of all as I'm sure you know first thing we're going to do is create a new script.

15

00:00:44,890  -->  00:00:49,690
We're going to save that on the desktop Python Bible cinema doppie.

16

00:00:49,710  -->  00:00:51,930
Why save that.

17

00:00:51,930  -->  00:00:52,780
Maximize it.

18

00:00:52,920  -->  00:00:54,660
And we're all good to go.

19

00:00:55,260  -->  00:00:55,530
Right.

20

00:00:55,530  -->  00:01:02,040
So first we're going to create some kind of data structure to store information about our films.

21

00:01:02,040  -->  00:01:03,800
Now I'm going to use a dictionary for this.

22

00:01:03,840  -->  00:01:07,820
As each film is going to be its own key and have its own data.

23

00:01:08,070  -->  00:01:15,720
So since this current video is being filmed in about the middle of 2016 I'm just going to make you a

24

00:01:15,720  -->  00:01:19,710
list of some of the current films with random ages and seat numbers.

25

00:01:19,710  -->  00:01:23,250
But feel free to create your own dictionary with any films that you want.

26

00:01:23,550  -->  00:01:29,350
So the dictionary is going to store the age rating for the film and also the number of seats left.

27

00:01:29,490  -->  00:01:34,310
Let's make a dictionary called films and I'm going to create it like LA.

28

00:01:34,660  -->  00:01:42,560
Okay now inside here I'm going to put Finding Dory 3.

29

00:01:43,380  -->  00:01:49,800
So they have the the the age for this I'm going to say is three and there are five tickets.

30

00:01:49,890  -->  00:01:53,320
Let's say so and then you go have born.

31

00:01:54,600  -->  00:01:55,890
Pretty sure he's in the cinema.

32

00:01:56,160  -->  00:01:59,830
Eighteen and five.

33

00:02:00,000  -->  00:02:00,780
Tarzan

34

00:02:07,070  -->  00:02:10,740
Ghostbusters.

35

00:02:13,050  -->  00:02:17,210
Okay so let's put that in there 12 and 5.

36

00:02:17,370  -->  00:02:18,480
Okay so there we go.

37

00:02:18,510  -->  00:02:20,770
We've got our dictionary of films.

38

00:02:20,790  -->  00:02:24,730
Obviously you can add as many as you want and mix and match for what you desire.

39

00:02:24,820  -->  00:02:26,440
Girl leave it with those few.

40

00:02:26,640  -->  00:02:30,360
So I'm going to do a little cheat again now and I'm going use a while loop.

41

00:02:30,360  -->  00:02:33,810
So this program is going to run over and over again just like we did for Travis.

42

00:02:33,960  -->  00:02:38,040
But don't worry we're going to cover loops in detail in the next section shula's Bear with me for now

43

00:02:38,070  -->  00:02:38,160
.

44

00:02:38,210  -->  00:02:40,350
Just going to type while True.

45

00:02:40,410  -->  00:02:43,350
And now put our code inside here okay.

46

00:02:43,650  -->  00:02:47,720
So now we need to ask the user what film they want to watch.

47

00:02:47,910  -->  00:02:49,220
So there's a micro challenge.

48

00:02:49,290  -->  00:02:55,200
Go ahead and ask the user what film they want to watch using the input function and store that choice

49

00:02:55,290  -->  00:02:58,100
in a variable called choice.

50

00:02:58,200  -->  00:02:59,110
You know the drill.

51

00:02:59,130  -->  00:03:05,060
Pause the video have a go and come back to see how you did.

52

00:03:05,130  -->  00:03:06,590
So how did you get on.

53

00:03:06,600  -->  00:03:12,500
I'd have done it like this and it's done in here type choice equals input.

54

00:03:12,570  -->  00:03:20,530
What film would you like to watch that and just in case the enter some white space.

55

00:03:20,550  -->  00:03:23,390
I'm just going to strip it off right there.

56

00:03:23,910  -->  00:03:32,580
And also actually because as you can see every single one of the films that I've put here in a key every

57

00:03:32,580  -->  00:03:35,660
word starts with a capital letter.

58

00:03:35,910  -->  00:03:36,410
Right.

59

00:03:36,630  -->  00:03:43,050
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the title string method as well to convert whatever they

60

00:03:43,050  -->  00:03:49,830
put into title case so there every If they enter Ghostbusters then Ghost will start with a capital G

61

00:03:49,830  -->  00:03:54,320
and bust as we start with capital B regardless of how you know they might type it themselves.

62

00:03:54,330  -->  00:03:56,000
So what is going to do that right there.

63

00:03:56,280  -->  00:04:00,990
Now if you follow along with this and if you got back early or you've just been following along then

64

00:04:00,990  -->  00:04:06,420
you're doing absolutely brilliantly because now we're going to start kicking off to more hard core things

65

00:04:06,450  -->  00:04:08,400
.

66

00:04:10,080  -->  00:04:16,020
Okay so now we need to check if the film that the user has chosen in choice is in the list of films

67

00:04:16,020  -->  00:04:16,590
.

68

00:04:16,590  -->  00:04:19,920
Now this is very easy to do just by using the in keyword right.

69

00:04:19,920  -->  00:04:25,360
So if let's just check if choice in films.

70

00:04:25,800  -->  00:04:33,060
Now actually I'm just going to introduce you to the pass Keyword the passkey word basically just tells

71

00:04:33,060  -->  00:04:33,850
python.

72

00:04:34,050  -->  00:04:35,150
Just move on.

73

00:04:35,310  -->  00:04:35,550
OK.

74

00:04:35,580  -->  00:04:37,120
This is just a blank place holder.

75

00:04:37,110  -->  00:04:39,290
We're not going to actually write the code in here yet.

76

00:04:39,360  -->  00:04:41,730
I'm just building the the structure.

77

00:04:41,910  -->  00:04:51,520
So if the choice is in there just pass and do nothing or otherwise print we don't have that film.

78

00:04:52,870  -->  00:04:55,170
And I'm going to make it build suspense.

79

00:04:55,750  -->  00:04:59,750
So much should be pretty good like that.

80

00:05:00,130  -->  00:05:06,400
Now when we run it like we run it I'm going to say Tarzan is not going to do anything.

81

00:05:06,400  -->  00:05:11,630
Rochas are in it found the film but it just saw pass and went back around the loop.

82

00:05:11,620  -->  00:05:18,530
Now if we run it again and say Rocky 7 and so then we don't have that film.

83

00:05:18,560  -->  00:05:21,970
So our logic is working which is brilliant.

84

00:05:23,100  -->  00:05:24,960
Okay so let's stop this thing running.

85

00:05:25,030  -->  00:05:33,250
The next thing we've got to do is we've got to check whether the user is old enough to watch the film

86

00:05:33,250  -->  00:05:33,690
.

87

00:05:33,700  -->  00:05:39,560
So what I can do is if the choice is in the films room if the choices they're winning to check whether

88

00:05:39,560  -->  00:05:42,810
the use is old enough of say age equals input.

89

00:05:42,920  -->  00:05:45,700
How old are you.

90

00:05:46,450  -->  00:05:46,980
Okay.

91

00:05:47,190  -->  00:05:50,410
And I'm going to strip whatever comes off from that.

92

00:05:51,070  -->  00:05:57,020
So how can we take whatever they put out and compare it with the age that's in here.

93

00:05:57,190  -->  00:06:04,620
Well first of all we actually need to make sure that age is a number never you remember.

94

00:06:05,080  -->  00:06:11,300
When I was talking over the input function it always brings in a string.

95

00:06:11,410  -->  00:06:14,800
Okay it even if you type a number it saves it as a string.

96

00:06:14,810  -->  00:06:21,790
So to convert all of this into an integer we to actually cast it from a string into an integer.

97

00:06:21,800  -->  00:06:28,550
So here we get a string we strip any white space off it and then we convert that whole thing into an

98

00:06:28,550  -->  00:06:34,360
integer indoor into a number and save that in the age now.

99

00:06:34,530  -->  00:06:44,240
Now what we need to check is if that age is greater than or equal to the age requirement for the film

100

00:06:44,250  -->  00:06:44,460
.

101

00:06:44,650  -->  00:06:45,770
So how do we know that.

102

00:06:45,980  -->  00:06:50,460
Well we go in the film's dictionary look up the film that they chose.

103

00:06:50,560  -->  00:06:58,300
So let's say they entered Tarzan wrote this this if we look up the key of Tarzan it's going to give

104

00:06:58,310  -->  00:07:00,310
us back this list.

105

00:07:00,310  -->  00:07:03,320
Now the age is the first element in that list.

106

00:07:03,350  -->  00:07:06,020
So I'm going to type in index zero.

107

00:07:06,070  -->  00:07:10,280
So we're looking up the choice as a key in the films.

108

00:07:10,340  -->  00:07:15,280
Now you know it makes sense why we had to get it in Title Case and we had to strip everything off and

109

00:07:15,280  -->  00:07:22,840
once we've got the value which will be this this list we're going to look up the first element in it

110

00:07:22,940  -->  00:07:29,420
which corresponds to the age and if their age is greater than or equal to that then we're going to print

111

00:07:29,410  -->  00:07:31,960
.

112

00:07:31,970  -->  00:07:33,960
Enjoy the film.

113

00:07:34,340  -->  00:07:34,870
OK.

114

00:07:35,090  -->  00:07:36,670
We'll come onto tickets and a little bit.

115

00:07:36,880  -->  00:07:40,690
But otherwise if they're not old enough we'll get a print.

116

00:07:41,290  -->  00:07:45,940
You are too young to see that film.

117

00:07:46,610  -->  00:07:49,450
Okay so let's have a look.

118

00:07:50,260  -->  00:07:53,450
Let's have a look at how that works.

119

00:07:53,480  -->  00:07:54,950
So what film would you like to watch.

120

00:07:54,950  -->  00:07:56,410
So say we want to watch Tarzan.

121

00:07:56,440  -->  00:07:56,970
How old are you.

122

00:07:56,990  -->  00:07:59,400
Let's say I'm 5 year old.

123

00:07:59,440  -->  00:08:00,930
You're too young to see that film.

124

00:08:01,090  -->  00:08:07,450
Okay so let's say if we won or what Tarzan again let's say now I'm ninety nine.

125

00:08:07,450  -->  00:08:10,570
Enjoy the film right so that works absolutely fine right there.

126

00:08:10,560  -->  00:08:11,790
So take another example.

127

00:08:12,010  -->  00:08:17,450
Let's say if we want to watch Finding Dory.

128

00:08:17,620  -->  00:08:18,430
How old are you.

129

00:08:18,440  -->  00:08:20,770
I want I am say nine years old.

130

00:08:20,770  -->  00:08:21,380
Enjoy the film.

131

00:08:21,380  -->  00:08:22,500
That works fine as well.

132

00:08:22,730  -->  00:08:27,730
So let's cancel that out and depressing Control see.

133

00:08:28,150  -->  00:08:35,660
And now we need to build the bit where it checks the number of tickets.

134

00:08:36,860  -->  00:08:41,530
So to check whether there are enough tickets instead of just letting them you know enjoy the film straight

135

00:08:41,530  -->  00:08:43,190
away after checking their age.

136

00:08:43,270  -->  00:08:47,390
I'm going to write here check check user age in here.

137

00:08:47,380  -->  00:08:47,780
Wait a minute.

138

00:08:47,810  -->  00:08:49,000
Just with a comment.

139

00:08:49,510  -->  00:08:52,240
Check user age now in here.

140

00:08:52,270  -->  00:08:56,410
We'll go to check check enough seats.

141

00:08:56,520  -->  00:08:57,040
Right.

142

00:08:57,350  -->  00:09:00,560
So if how do we how do we know the number of seats.

143

00:09:00,880  -->  00:09:05,240
Well the number of seats is this is the second element.

144

00:09:05,360  -->  00:09:10,610
So if the films of that choice.

145

00:09:10,880  -->  00:09:11,200
Yes.

146

00:09:11,200  -->  00:09:15,440
This is the the Basically this list for the corresponding film.

147

00:09:15,430  -->  00:09:23,780
If the seats of that which is element 1 is greater than or equal or bet we can just say if that's greater

148

00:09:23,770  -->  00:09:30,390
than zero right then they will then will get to tell them enjoy the film.

149

00:09:31,100  -->  00:09:37,470
We tell them enjoy the film and we're going to subtract one from the number of tickets left.

150

00:09:37,550  -->  00:09:43,200
So films choice 1.

151

00:09:45,730  -->  00:09:57,030
Not messing up films of choice one equals films of choice one minus one.

152

00:09:57,130  -->  00:09:57,550
Okay.

153

00:09:57,650  -->  00:10:03,680
So were taking whatever the value is for the number of tickets and we're subtracting one from it then

154

00:10:03,680  -->  00:10:09,020
saving it back in there another way that we can do this to make it a bit clearer.

155

00:10:09,020  -->  00:10:15,990
We could say numb seats equals films of choice 1 Okay.

156

00:10:16,100  -->  00:10:21,480
And if not seats is greater than zero.

157

00:10:21,500  -->  00:10:22,960
They're going to say enjoy the film.

158

00:10:23,230  -->  00:10:23,830
I'm numb.

159

00:10:23,830  -->  00:10:30,680
Seats is going to become numb seats minus one.

160

00:10:31,340  -->  00:10:33,050
But actually that bit won't work.

161

00:10:33,050  -->  00:10:33,440
Actually no.

162

00:10:33,440  -->  00:10:35,940
We do need to change that film.

163

00:10:36,020  -->  00:10:38,600
Films choice it's going to become

164

00:10:46,760  -->  00:10:49,680
we did need to keep that the way that it was before.

165

00:10:49,790  -->  00:10:55,130
So we're just overwriting the number of seats right there.

166

00:10:55,130  -->  00:10:59,630
And that's pretty much it to be honest I think you guys lensless What's that work.

167

00:10:59,630  -->  00:11:01,720
So there's always five seats right.

168

00:11:01,730  -->  00:11:05,120
So what film joy to watch was cause a Tarzan cause diseases to spell.

169

00:11:05,120  -->  00:11:05,760
How old are you.

170

00:11:05,780  -->  00:11:07,190
Let's say three.

171

00:11:07,190  -->  00:11:08,490
You you're too young to see that film.

172

00:11:08,570  -->  00:11:09,260
Oh OK.

173

00:11:09,500  -->  00:11:11,550
If I'm Tarzan again watch in it.

174

00:11:11,570  -->  00:11:12,260
How old are you.

175

00:11:12,260  -->  00:11:13,500
I am 50.

176

00:11:13,870  -->  00:11:14,310
OK.

177

00:11:14,390  -->  00:11:17,810
So there should be four tickets Tarzan.

178

00:11:18,140  -->  00:11:18,950
I'm 15.

179

00:11:19,000  -->  00:11:19,370
Oh OK.

180

00:11:19,400  -->  00:11:21,560
No there should be three tickets Tarzan.

181

00:11:21,560  -->  00:11:22,430
I'm 15.

182

00:11:22,490  -->  00:11:25,370
Now there should be two tickets was 15.

183

00:11:25,460  -->  00:11:28,890
One ticket Tarzan 15.

184

00:11:28,910  -->  00:11:34,620
This down now there should be no tickets left Tarzan 15.

185

00:11:34,700  -->  00:11:37,620
And it actually didn't say enjoy the film.

186

00:11:37,750  -->  00:11:38,120
Okay.

187

00:11:38,130  -->  00:11:41,240
You did you know the way that we ran our tickets and it didn't say enjoy the film.

188

00:11:41,310  -->  00:11:45,050
We put in just another message in here.

189

00:11:45,680  -->  00:11:48,440
If number of seats is greater than zero then do all that.

190

00:11:48,530  -->  00:11:50,200
Else.

191

00:11:50,480  -->  00:11:51,840
Print.

192

00:11:51,980  -->  00:11:52,700
Sorry.

193

00:11:52,820  -->  00:11:55,910
We are sold out now.

194

00:11:55,940  -->  00:11:57,890
You think you can trust me that that works.

195

00:11:57,890  -->  00:11:59,830
You can run the code yourself.

196

00:12:00,070  -->  00:12:03,580
But trust me that's going to that's going to work fine.

197

00:12:03,590  -->  00:12:05,210
One thing that I do want to highlight though.

198

00:12:05,210  -->  00:12:09,890
Can you see the way that we've got if statements inside of if statements inside of if statements and

199

00:12:09,890  -->  00:12:17,880
all sorts of stuff going on there the way the python works to have something inside something else is

200

00:12:17,940  -->  00:12:19,810
you can see that it's indenting it.

201

00:12:19,940  -->  00:12:22,970
I mentioned this a bit earlier in the course but it makes more sense here.

202

00:12:23,000  -->  00:12:27,800
There's a certain amount of indenting going on and this saves you from having to type loads of brackets

203

00:12:27,800  -->  00:12:30,710
and loads of stuff like that load and which makes the code quite ugly.

204

00:12:30,710  -->  00:12:33,910
Like in programs like Java and C and things like that.

205

00:12:34,550  -->  00:12:37,210
But you do have to have the indentation.

206

00:12:37,200  -->  00:12:38,950
Otherwise Python just won't work.

207

00:12:38,950  -->  00:12:42,990
It won't be able to tell what's inside of something else.

208

00:12:43,070  -->  00:12:45,840
So make sure you get a indentation right.

209

00:12:45,860  -->  00:12:47,810
Idol's going to do it for you pretty much.

210

00:12:47,810  -->  00:12:51,590
I mean if you just go to the end of the line and press enter you can see whether it's automatically

211

00:12:51,590  -->  00:12:52,530
indented.

212

00:12:52,790  -->  00:12:56,270
And if I told another if it's going to automatically indented again.

213

00:12:56,450  -->  00:12:58,930
So you know idle's going to help you out with these things.

214

00:12:58,940  -->  00:13:04,070
But that does need to be right so if your code's not working and it says indentation error or something

215

00:13:04,070  -->  00:13:06,430
like that that's the problem.

216

00:13:06,510  -->  00:13:07,320
But awesome.

217

00:13:07,380  -->  00:13:09,680
I mean do you see how quick that was.

218

00:13:09,680  -->  00:13:15,020
We've just built a program that can actually check whether a user is old enough to watch a film and

219

00:13:15,020  -->  00:13:17,310
whether there are enough seats left in the system.

220

00:13:17,330  -->  00:13:23,660
Also updates itself when someone books a film and also reduces the number of seats by one and when someone

221

00:13:23,660  -->  00:13:25,250
purchases a ticket.

222

00:13:25,250  -->  00:13:30,290
If you understood all of that and followed along and did it yourself you should be so proud of yourself

223

00:13:30,350  -->  00:13:31,100
honestly.

224

00:13:31,280  -->  00:13:35,750
You're learning so much and you should share this victory with your friends so they can celebrate along

225

00:13:35,750  -->  00:13:36,080
with you.

226

00:13:36,080  -->  00:13:37,400
This is a really big achievement.

227

00:13:37,400  -->  00:13:38,490
I mean look at it man.

228

00:13:38,720  -->  00:13:48,170
Looking at you've got dictionaries strings less while lubes if statements and user input updating variables

229

00:13:48,170  -->  00:13:51,980
conditions logic all that stuff in there you should be so proud of yourself.

230

00:13:51,980  -->  00:13:54,220
Honestly I'm very proud of you as well.

231

00:13:54,260  -->  00:14:00,650
Now in this project we've applied data structures to create an assortment of films use plenty of logic

232

00:14:00,870  -->  00:14:08,090
data type conversions converting here we've been casting and basically using everything since the start

233

00:14:08,090  -->  00:14:10,190
of the cause into a functional program.

234

00:14:10,370  -->  00:14:14,630
And with that now we're going to end on a high and come to the end of this section of the course on

235

00:14:14,630  -->  00:14:18,950
data structures as you've like learned so much with this section of the course lets us have a quick

236

00:14:18,950  -->  00:14:24,860
recap in the next video to go over what we've learned just to make sure it all sticks and I'll see you

237

00:14:24,860  -->  00:14:26,120
in the next video.
