00:00:00,480  -->  00:00:02,180
Hello there you beautiful people.

2

00:00:02,190  -->  00:00:05,700
And welcome to the review lecture for this section on Python.

3

00:00:05,730  -->  00:00:11,040
Data Structures now in this sorrowful section of the course were really covered a lot and hopefully

4

00:00:11,100  -->  00:00:15,720
have you've gotten a very powerful tool that you can using your programs to structure your data and

5

00:00:15,720  -->  00:00:16,470
manipulate it.

6

00:00:16,470  -->  00:00:18,430
Really however you want.

7

00:00:18,510  -->  00:00:23,800
We started off by looking at lists the most common type of data structure in Python.

8

00:00:23,820  -->  00:00:25,090
First you learn the basics.

9

00:00:25,110  -->  00:00:30,570
And so what the list is and how to create one after that you learn the list can hold different types

10

00:00:30,570  -->  00:00:31,220
of data.

11

00:00:31,380  -->  00:00:35,880
And the lists are an Iterable data type which means they can be broken up into little pieces called

12

00:00:35,940  -->  00:00:36,710
elements.

13

00:00:36,900  -->  00:00:42,470
Each element is accessible via an index and you learn how to use indexes to access certain elements

14

00:00:42,510  -->  00:00:47,580
and also how to take slices through your lists to access multiple elements at once.

15

00:00:47,580  -->  00:00:52,620
Then we stepped it up a gear and you learn how to use lists to create multi-dimensional data structures

16

00:00:52,920  -->  00:00:58,470
like tables and use indexes like coordinates to access certain rows and columns.

17

00:00:58,530  -->  00:01:02,850
You only need this all the time but it might come in useful when you want to make a Rubik's Cube solver

18

00:01:02,940  -->  00:01:04,330
or something like that.

19

00:01:04,830  -->  00:01:09,210
So after that you built Travis the ridiculous but totally lovable secuity robot.

20

00:01:09,660  -->  00:01:14,410
In that project you heard all about how to add items to a list and how to delete them from a list.

21

00:01:14,520  -->  00:01:19,230
You learned how data structures can be combined with logic systems and you also introduce to the.

22

00:01:19,230  -->  00:01:24,440
In keyword word which checks whether some value is in an Iterable data type.

23

00:01:24,450  -->  00:01:28,770
You also learned about the non data type which she learned how to manage their use of lists methods

24

00:01:28,770  -->  00:01:31,480
correctly so that you don't accidentally delete your data.

25

00:01:31,900  -->  00:01:34,460
After that we started talking all about tuples.

26

00:01:34,500  -->  00:01:38,550
You learn that tools are basically like lists except that they're immutable which means they cannot

27

00:01:38,550  -->  00:01:40,180
be changed once you have created them.

28

00:01:40,200  -->  00:01:43,890
And this keeps your data safe at the expense of some flexibility.

29

00:01:43,890  -->  00:01:48,450
You know how to create two balls and your cylinder call trick called multiple assignment where you can

30

00:01:48,450  -->  00:01:52,150
create multiple variables with just one line of code.

31

00:01:52,170  -->  00:01:54,660
After that we moved on to the dictionary data type.

32

00:01:54,710  -->  00:01:59,970
Now dictionaries are a glorious data type that allow us to look at values with easy to remember keys

33

00:01:59,970  -->  00:02:00,520
.

34

00:02:00,570  -->  00:02:04,770
You made a mini database of students and stored their ages under their names.

35

00:02:04,770  -->  00:02:10,170
You don't have to add new keys to dictionaries head update their values and how to delete them.

36

00:02:10,200  -->  00:02:16,230
You also learned about the keys values and items methods for dictionaries to get addiction's keys values

37

00:02:16,230  -->  00:02:22,380
and items respectively and also how to get this information in list format using the list function.

38

00:02:22,430  -->  00:02:28,590
Now if all of that wasn't enough yourself had had to put lists and even dictionaries inside of dictionaries

39

00:02:28,890  -->  00:02:31,240
which gave your dictionaries superpower's basically.

40

00:02:31,290  -->  00:02:37,530
We use this to store not only a student's name but also their age their student I.D. and their grade

41

00:02:37,530  -->  00:02:38,490
.

42

00:02:38,490  -->  00:02:43,680
Then finally we combine all of the stuff we've learned so far in the course to make a cinema booking

43

00:02:43,680  -->  00:02:44,580
system.

44

00:02:44,580  -->  00:02:50,550
This program combined everything we know so far about variables numbers strings logic and data structures

45

00:02:50,760  -->  00:02:53,140
to really show off your skills as a python pro.

46

00:02:53,250  -->  00:02:54,650
So bravo.

47

00:02:54,810  -->  00:02:59,520
This section has really brought a lot of new skills to the table and I hope you really let these concepts

48

00:02:59,520  -->  00:03:00,060
sink in.

49

00:03:00,090  -->  00:03:05,770
As they'll come in useful time and time and time and time and time again.

50

00:03:06,360  -->  00:03:11,970
Oh sorry was I repeating myself words probably because the next section of the Course is on loops loops

51

00:03:11,970  -->  00:03:17,600
help to automate the task of programming itself and are a critical piece of every programming tool kit

52

00:03:18,150  -->  00:03:20,390
loops l.a. to do in one line of code.

53

00:03:20,400  -->  00:03:25,950
What might take hundreds or thousands or even millions of lines of code to do otherwise and Python makes

54

00:03:25,950  -->  00:03:28,020
them crazily easy to do.

55

00:03:28,050  -->  00:03:32,920
Now you're not going to want to miss this so see you in the next video.
